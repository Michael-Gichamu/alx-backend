# 0x01. Caching

The project focused on the concept of caching and caching replacement policies. Caching is a fundamental technique in computer science and information technology that involves storing frequently accessed data or resources in a temporary, high-speed memory location, typically closer to the CPU or the user, to reduce access times and improve system performance.

In this project, the primary objective was to explore how caching works and, more specifically, to delve into the various strategies and policies employed to manage the data stored in the cache. Caching replacement policies are rules or algorithms that dictate which items should be evicted from the cache when it becomes full, making room for new data. The choice of a replacement policy can significantly impact the efficiency of a caching system.
